# Collection of ASCII Art Character Sets (Space to ~)

This repository contains one or more text files (e.g., `larry3d.txt`, `standard.txt`) that each provide ASCII art representations for all printable ASCII characters, ranging from space (ASCII code 32) to tilde (ASCII code 126).

## Contents

The repository includes multiple `.txt` files. Each file contains a complete set of ASCII art for the characters from space to tilde.

Within each `.txt` file:

- The ASCII art for each character maintains a consistent height across all characters in that file.
- The width of the ASCII art for each character may vary.
- The ASCII art for each character is separated by a newline, creating a vertical list of character representations.
- The order of the ASCII art in the file corresponds to the ASCII values, starting with space, then '!', '"', and so on, up to '~'.

## Purpose

This structure allows for different stylistic representations of the entire ASCII printable character set, where each set maintains a uniform height. This can be useful for:

- **Exploring Different Styles:** Comparing various visual interpretations of the ASCII characters.
- **Consistent Height Integration:** Easily using character art within contexts that require a fixed height.
- **Bulk Access:** Providing a single file to extract all character art for a specific style.

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository and select a `.txt` file (e.g., `larry3d.txt`) representing the desired ASCII art style.
2. Open the file. You will see a vertical list of ASCII art, with each character's representation on a new line, ordered from space to tilde.
3. Copy the ASCII art for the specific character you need. Be mindful of the newline separation when integrating it into your projects.

## Contributing

Contributions of new `.txt` files, each containing a complete and consistently-heighted ASCII art set for the printable characters, are highly encouraged!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new `.txt` file (give it a descriptive name if you like).
3. Within the file, create the ASCII art for each character from space to tilde, ensuring:
    - All characters in your set have the same height.
    - Each character's art is separated by a single newline.
    - The order of characters matches their ASCII values.
4. Submit a pull request with your new file.

Please strive for clarity and visual appeal in your ASCII art.
